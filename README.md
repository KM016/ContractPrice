# The Task

The goal of this project was to create a pricing model that can be used to evaluate the value of natural gas storage contracts. The trading desk wanted to store natural gas in the summer when prices are lower and sell it in the winter to take advantage of higher prices. The model needs to account for storage costs, injection/withdrawal rates, and transportation fees. This model serves as a prototype that will undergo further validation before being put into production.

### Data

The project builds upon the previous task of estimating and forecasting natural gas prices. The natural gas prices from the previous model are used as inputs to evaluate contracts. The key data points include injection and withdrawal dates, the amount of gas injected, and storage-related costs.

### Project Goals

- **Develop a pricing model**: Build a Python function that evaluates contract values based on injection/withdrawal dates and costs.
- **Input parameters**:
  - Injection dates
  - Withdrawal dates
  - Natural gas prices on the dates
  - Injection/withdrawal rate
  - Maximum storage volume
  - Storage costs
  - Transportation costs
- **Generalise the model**: The model must handle multiple contracts and output their values.

### Steps Involved

1. **Define key input parameters**: The user specifies injection dates, withdrawal dates, storage fees, transportation costs, and maximum volumes.
2. **Estimate natural gas prices**: The prices at the time of injection and withdrawal are estimated using the previously developed forecasting model.
3. **Calculate contract value**: For each contract, the total cost of storage, injection/withdrawal fees, and transportation is subtracted from the revenue generated by selling the gas at a higher price during withdrawal.
4. **Output the contract values**: The function returns the contract value for each storage period.

# The Code

Key components of the code include:

- `contract_price(injectionDate, withdrawDate, storageCost, i_w_cost, maxVolume, rate, transpCost)`: This function calculates the total value of each natural gas contract based on the input parameters and returns the contract values.
